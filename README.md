### 💻 About Me

I'm a flexible and curious IT student from Oman, passionate about exploring different areas of technology. I've experimented with:

- 🌐 Web development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- 🧠 AI & Sentiment Analysis (using Python)
- 🔐 Cybersecurity (malware analysis, file encryption, phishing detection)
- 🤖 Bot scripting (automating tasks and interactions)
- 🎮 Game modding (customizing maps, behavior, and experience)

Most of my projects were personal and educational — made to learn, break, and build. I enjoy solving problems, thinking creatively, and learning fast.
